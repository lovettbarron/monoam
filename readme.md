### MONOME Sequencer:
Install Max/MSP lib (included in repo, or install from http://noam.io)
Run `noam_monome_sequencer.maxpat` via the Max/MSP Runtime (written in max5)
Made for a Monome 128, but can use on-screen grid.

### Mobile Web App
npm install && node app.js
Go to http://localhost:3000
Place phone in pocket, tap away

### Robot Xylophone
Yeah...
Arduino + Wifi shield + Array of solonoids

Thanks to:
Joe Saavedra for releasing Monome sequencer as baseline for the patch.
